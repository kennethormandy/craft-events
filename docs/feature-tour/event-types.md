# Event Types
**Event Types** help you categorize and differentiate between various kinds of events. Think of them like sections or categories in Craft CMS, but specifically for events. Each event type can have its own unique settings, and you can use it to organize and manage different kinds of events in your system.

For example, you might create event types like:
- Concerts
- Conferences
- Workshops
- Meetups

Each event type can have its own field layout, which allows you to customize the fields and layout specific to that type. This is great for tailoring the experience depending on the type of event you’re organizing.

For example, a “Concert” event type might need specific fields like the artist lineup or genre, while a “Workshop” might include fields for the instructor’s name or required materials. With event types, you can set up unique layouts to reflect these differences.
