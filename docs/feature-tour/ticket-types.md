# Ticket Types
**Ticket Types** define what kinds of tickets are available for an event. Think of them as the blueprint for how actual tickets will be created. Each ticket type represents a unique tier or category of tickets, allowing you to offer different pricing, capacities, and availability windows.

For example, you might offer **General Admission**, **VIP**, or **Early Bird** tickets, each with its own price and capacity. Each event can have multiple ticket types, making it easy to create a variety of options for attendees.

## Title
The **Title** of the ticket type represents the name of the ticket as seen by your attendees. This could be anything from a basic “General Admission” ticket to something more specific like “VIP Access” or “Student Discount.”

Make the title descriptive enough so attendees know exactly what they’re purchasing.

## Price
This is where you define the **Price** for each ticket type. The price is what attendees will pay to purchase a ticket. You can set different prices for different ticket types within the same event, making it easy to offer tiered experiences (e.g., standard vs. VIP).

## Capacity
The **Capacity** setting defines how many tickets of this type can be sold. Each ticket type has its own capacity, allowing you to control how many tickets are available for each category.

If you have an overall event capacity, the total number of tickets sold across all ticket types cannot exceed that limit (unless manually overridden at the event level).

## Availability
The **Available From** and **Available To** settings let you define when tickets can be purchased. These settings allow you to control the window of time during which tickets are available for sale, adding flexibility to your ticketing strategy.

- **Available From:** The date and time when this ticket type becomes available for purchase.
- **Available To**: The date and time after which this ticket type can no longer be purchased.

This is particularly useful for things like early bird tickets, limited-time offers, or tickets that go on sale at a specific time (e.g., concert presales).
