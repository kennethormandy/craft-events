# Events

Events manage the tickets your customers can purchase. Tickets are very similar to Commerce Products, and in fact are [purchasables](https://craftcommerce.com/docs/purchasables), allowing it to make use of many core Commerce functions.

### Create an Event

Go to the main section for Events in your control panel main menu. This will list all the events you've created.

:::tip
Before you can start creating events, you'll first need to set up an [Event Type â†’](docs:feature-tour/ticket-types)

Each field is fairly self-explanatory, but any additional information is provided below.
