# Sessions
Events often take place over multiple times or locations, and that’s where **Sessions** come in. A session represents a single instance of the event happening at a specific time and place. It's in the session where you define the start and end date/times for your gathering, rather than on the event element itself.

For example, if you’re hosting a three-day conference, each day could be a separate session. Or, if you have multiple performances of a play, each performance would be a different session.

A session’s title is automatically generated based on your Event Type’s **Session Title Format** setting.

## Dates
Every session requires a **Start Date** and **End Date**. These dates control when the session begins and ends. They’re separate from the event itself, allowing you to define multiple occurrences under one event. For example, each session of a multi-day event will have its own specific dates.

If your session doesn’t need specific start and end times, and is simply running all day, you can enable the **All Day** option. When this is checked, the start and end times are removed, and the session is considered an all-day event.

This is useful for events that span an entire day without specific time slots, such as open festivals or exhibitions.

## Frequency
Sessions can also occur on a recurring basis, which is where the **Frequency** setting comes into play. It's only available when you first create a session!

You can set a session to happen:
- Once
- Daily
- Weekly
- Monthly

These recurrence rules define how the session repeats over time, allowing you to easily manage events that happen more than once. Based on your selected frequency, individual sessions are automatically generated to match your recurrence settings.

::: tip
You can even register custom recurrence rules to extend this functionality.

### Daily
The Daily option allows you to repeat a session every few days, giving you control over how many days apart each occurrence should be.

- **Repeat every X days**: Define how many days should pass between each session. For example, setting this to “2” will schedule the session every second day.
- **End on a specific date**: You can specify an exact end date for the recurring sessions.
- **End after a certain number of occurrences**: Alternatively, you can specify how many times the session should repeat (e.g., repeat 10 times).

### Weekly
The Weekly option provides flexibility for sessions that repeat on specific days of the week. You can control how many weeks to skip between occurrences and which days of the week the session should take place.

- **Repeat every X weeks**: Define how many weeks apart each occurrence is. For example, setting this to “2” will repeat the session every two weeks.
- **Choose specific days of the week**: Pick one or more days of the week for the session to occur. For instance, you might want a session every Monday and Wednesday. Note that you are required to pick the same day of the week the **Start Date** falls on.
- **End on a specific date**: Specify an end date for the recurring session.
- **End after a certain number of occurrences**: Specify how many total occurrences you want.

### Monthly
The Monthly option is perfect for events that repeat on a monthly basis. You can choose how many months to skip between occurrences, and whether the session should occur on a specific date or a specific weekday within the month.

- **Repeat every X months**: Define how many months should pass between occurrences. For example, setting this to “1” will repeat the session every month.
- **Choose a specific day of the month**: You can pick an exact day of the month for the session to occur (e.g., the 15th of each month).
- **Choose an ordinal weekday**: Alternatively, you can set the session to repeat on the first, second, third, etc., occurrence of a specific weekday in the month (e.g., the second Friday of each month).
- **End on a specific date**: You can specify an end date for the recurrence.
- **End after a certain number of occurrences**: Define how many total occurrences you want.

## Managing Recurring Sessions
When managing a recurring session, you may need to make changes that affect one or more occurrences. The plugin allows you to control which instances are updated or deleted when you make changes:

- **This occurrence**: Changes only apply to the current session you’re editing.
- **All occurrences**: Changes apply to all sessions in the series.
- **This and all future occurrences**: Changes apply to the session you’re editing and all future sessions in the series.
- **Custom range**: Apply changes to a specific range of sessions in the series.

This ensures you can fine-tune your recurring events without impacting sessions you don’t want to change, and without the hassle of editing sessions one-by-one.
