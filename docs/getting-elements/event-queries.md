# Event Queries

You can fetch events in your templates or PHP code using **event queries**.

:::code
```twig Twig
{# Create a new event query #}
{% set myQuery = craft.events.events() %}
```

```php PHP
// Create a new event query
$myQuery = \verbb\events\elements\Event::find();
```
:::

Once you’ve created an event query, you can set parameters on it to narrow down the results, and then execute it by calling `.all()`. An array of [Event](docs:developers/event) objects will be returned.

:::tip
See Introduction to [Element Queries](https://docs.craftcms.com/v3/dev/element-queries/) in the Craft docs to learn about how element queries work.
:::

## Example

We can display events for a given type by doing the following:

1. Create an event query with `craft.events.events()`.
2. Set the [type](#type) and [limit](#limit) parameters on it.
3. Fetch all events with `.all()` and output.
4. Loop through the events using a [for](https://twig.symfony.com/doc/2.x/tags/for.html) tag to output the contents.

```twig
{# Create a events query with the 'type' and 'limit' parameters #}
{% set eventsQuery = craft.events.events()
    .type('generalEvents')
    .limit(10) %}

{# Fetch the Events #}
{% set events = eventsQuery.all() %}

{# Display their contents #}
{% for event in events %}
    <p>{{ event.title }}</p>
{% endfor %}
```

:::warning
By default, only current events will be returned when calling `craft.events.events()`. To change this, use `craft.events.events({ endDate: null })`. Events are also ordered from the oldest startDate to the newest, which you can also change with the `orderBy` parameter.
:::

## Parameters

Event queries support the following parameters:

<!-- BEGIN PARAMS -->
