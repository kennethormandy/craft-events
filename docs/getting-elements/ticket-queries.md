# Ticket Queries

You can fetch tickets in your templates or PHP code using **ticket queries**.

::: code
```twig
{# Create a new ticket query #}
{% set myTicketQuery = craft.events.tickets() %}
```
```php
// Create a new ticket query
$myTicketQuery = \verbb\events\elements\Ticket::find();
```
:::

Once you’ve created a ticket query, you can set [parameters](#parameters) on it to narrow down the results, and then [execute it](https://docs.craftcms.com/v3/dev/element-queries/#executing-element-queries) by calling `.all()`. An array of [Ticket](docs:developers/ticket) objects will be returned.

::: tip
See [Introduction to Element Queries](https://docs.craftcms.com/v3/dev/element-queries/) in the Craft docs to learn about how element queries work.
:::

## Example

We can display a specific ticket by its ID by doing the following:

1. Create a ticket query with `craft.events.tickets()`.
2. Set the [id](#id) parameter on it.
3. Fetch the ticket with `.one()`.
4. Output information about the ticket as HTML.

```twig
{# Get the requested ticket ID from the query string #}
{% set ticketId = craft.app.request.getQueryParam('id') %}

{# Create a ticket query with the 'id' parameter #}
{% set myTicketQuery = craft.events.tickets()
    .id(ticketId) %}

{# Fetch the ticket #}
{% set ticket = myTicketQuery.one() %}

{# Make sure it exists #}
{% if not ticket %}
    {% exit 404 %}
{% endif %}

{# Display the ticket #}
<h1>{{ ticket.title }}</h1>
<!-- ... -->
```

### `anyStatus`

Clears out the [status()](https://docs.craftcms.com/api/v3/craft-elements-db-elementquery.html#method-status) and [enabledForSite()](https://docs.craftcms.com/api/v3/craft-elements-db-elementquery.html#method-enabledforsite) parameters.

::: code
```twig
{# Fetch all tickets, regardless of status #}
{% set tickets = craft.events.tickets()
    .anyStatus()
    .all() %}
```

```php
// Fetch all tickets, regardless of status
$tickets = \verbb\events\elements\Ticket::find()
    ->anyStatus()
    ->all();
```
:::



### `asArray`

Causes the query to return matching tickets as arrays of data, rather than [Ticket](docs:developers/ticket) objects.

::: code
```twig
{# Fetch tickets as arrays #}
{% set tickets = craft.events.tickets()
    .asArray()
    .all() %}
```

```php
// Fetch tickets as arrays
$tickets = \verbb\events\elements\Ticket::find()
    ->asArray()
    ->all();
```
:::



### `customer`

Narrows the query results to only tickets that have been purchased by a customer.

::: code
```twig
{# Fetch tickets that have been purchased by a customer #}
{% set tickets = craft.events.tickets()
    .customer(craft.commerce.getCarts().getCart().customer)
    .all() %}
```

```php
// Fetch tickets that have been purchased by a customer
$tickets = \verbb\events\elements\Event::find()
    ->customer($customer)
    ->all();
````
:::



### `dateCreated`

Narrows the query results based on the tickets’ creation dates.

Possible values include:

| Value | Fetches tickets…

| `'< 2018-05-01'` | that were created before 2018-05-01
| `['and', '>= 2018-04-04', '< 2018-05-01']` | that were created between 2018-04-01 and 2018-05-01.

::: code
```twig
{# Fetch tickets created last month #}
{% set start = date('first day of last month')|atom %}
{% set end = date('first day of this month')|atom %}

{% set tickets = craft.events.tickets()
    .dateCreated(['and', ">= #{start}", "< #{end}"])
    .all() %}
```

```php
// Fetch tickets created last month
$start = new \DateTime('first day of next month')->format(\DateTime::ATOM);
$end = new \DateTime('first day of this month')->format(\DateTime::ATOM);

$tickets = \verbb\events\elements\Ticket::find()
    ->dateCreated(['and', ">= {$start}", "< {$end}"])
    ->all();
```
:::



### `dateUpdated`

Narrows the query results based on the tickets’ last-updated dates.

Possible values include:

| `['and', '>= 2018-04-04', '< 2018-05-01']` | that were updated between 2018-04-01 and 2018-05-01.

::: code
```twig
{# Fetch tickets updated in the last week #}
{% set lastWeek = date('1 week ago')|atom %}

{% set tickets = craft.events.tickets()
    .dateUpdated(">= #{lastWeek}")
    .all() %}
```

```php
// Fetch tickets updated in the last week
$lastWeek = new \DateTime('1 week ago')->format(\DateTime::ATOM);

$tickets = \verbb\events\elements\Ticket::find()
    ->dateUpdated(">= {$lastWeek}")
    ->all();
```
:::



### `fixedOrder`

Causes the query results to be returned in the order specified by [id](#id).

::: code
```twig
{# Fetch tickets in a specific order #}
{% set tickets = craft.events.tickets()
    .id([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])
    .fixedOrder()
    .all() %}
```

```php
// Fetch tickets in a specific order
$tickets = \verbb\events\elements\Ticket::find()
    ->id([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])

    ->all();
```
:::

    .one() %}
```

```php
// Fetch the ticket by its ID
$ticket = \verbb\events\elements\Ticket::find()
    ->id(1)
    ->one();
```
:::

::: tip
This can be combined with [fixedOrder](#fixedorder) if you want the results to be returned in a specific order.
:::



### `inReverse`

Causes the query results to be returned in reverse order.

```twig
{# Fetch tickets in reverse #}
